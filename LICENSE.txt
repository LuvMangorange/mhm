Note on Numerical Recipes License
==============

Be aware that some code is under the Numerical Recipes License 3rd edition <http://www.nr.com/aboutNR3license.html>
The Numerical Recipes Personal Single-User License lets you personally use Numerical Recipes code ("the code") on any number of computers, but only one computer at a time. You are not permitted to allow anyone else to access or use the code. You may, under this license, transfer precompiled, executable applications incorporating the code to other, unlicensed, persons, providing that (i) the application is noncommercial (i.e., does not involve the selling or licensing of the application for a fee), and (ii) the application was first developed, compiled, and successfully run by you, and (iii) the code is bound into the application in such a manner that it cannot be accessed as individual routines and cannot practicably be unbound and used in other programs. That is, under this license, your application user must not be able to use Numerical Recipes code as part of a program library or "mix and match" workbench.
Businesses and organizations that purchase the disk or code download, and that thus acquire one or more Numerical Recipes Personal Single-User Licenses, may permanently assign those licenses, in the number acquired, to individual employees. Such an assignment must be made before the code is first used and, once made, it is irrevocable and can not be transferred.
If you do not hold a Numerical Recipes License, this code is only for informational and educational purposes but cannot be used.
