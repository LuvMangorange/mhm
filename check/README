        MAKE TEST
----------------------------------------

To run all the test cases type 

     $ make test

on your command line. If test case was running properly, i.e. is 
consistent with the pre-defined output, command line output will be 

     $ case #[id] o.k. 

otherwise, if the test scenario failed either during runtime or 
because of inconsistent output 

     $ case #[id] failed

will be written on standard output. Additionally, you will find a file
mhm.output in each specific test case folder case_[id]/ containing the 
mHM print-outs. Inspecting this file might help you to find the reason 
of failure. Only if all test cases pass the make test, a new feature
of mHM is allowed to be committed via

     $ svn commit -m "mo_[module name]: I have added this feature."

Please be aware that the test cases only include switches specified 
within a namelist. This means that you should run "make test" with 
the Makefile setting for

    (1a) compiler = Gnu
    (1b) compiler = Nag
    (1c) compiler = Intel
    (2a) openmp   = true
    (2b) openmp   = false
