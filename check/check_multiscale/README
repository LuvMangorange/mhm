        Test Multiscale Feature
----------------------------------------

- a test case for the multiscale feature still has to be designed

- up till now the multiscale feature was tested with the enclodes mhm.nml
- the setup is made up out of 6 versions of the test basin

       resolution_Hydrology(1)  = 24000 
       resolution_Hydrology(2)  = 12000 
       resolution_Hydrology(3)  = 12000 
       resolution_Hydrology(4)  = 24000 
       resolution_Hydrology(5)  = 12000 
       resolution_Hydrology(6)  = 12000  

       resolution_Routing(1)    = 48000 
       resolution_Routing(2)    = 24000 
       resolution_Routing(3)  	= 48000
       resolution_Routing(4)  	= 48000 
       resolution_Routing(5) 	= 24000 
       resolution_Routing(6)  	= 48000	  

- it was checked that all results are equal when the L0 data is read only for the first basin
  and when read for every basin
- furthermore run 1,2,3 are equal to 4,5,6 and it was checked they also produce the same results
- a second, differing basin should be used for the test as well

- to run this test with the current trunk (15.04.2014) will lead to mistakes in the daily_discharge 
  file strating with basin 3
