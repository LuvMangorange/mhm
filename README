TODOS
- move writing of config from mo_write_ascii to mRM
- write config for mRM separately within mRM
- remove double allocation of L0 variables (i.e., L0_elev, L0_LCover)
- restart needs to be revised (after merge with trunk, L0_areaCell, and
  L1_areaCell are should be moved to the restart of mRM)
