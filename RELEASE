----------------------------------------
     FEATURES OF mHM v5.0
     (released at Dec 1st, 2013)
----------------------------------------

Features:
- full modular version
- automatic documentation by doxygen
- running mHM for multiple basin simultaneously
- definition of 8 major processes: 
       interception, snow, soilmoisture, direct runoff, evapotranspiration, interflow, percolation, routing, geology
  and intended implementation of several process descriptions
- general structure of input data as *.bin or *.nc
- various calibration routines and objective functions
- consistent precision handling of variables

Bugs resolved:
- None.

Known bugs:
- None.

     FEATURES OF mHM v5.1
     (released at Jun 1st, 2014)
----------------------------------------

Features:
- OpenMP handling of routines such as the multi-scale parameter regionalization (MPR)
- Multi-scale implementation, i.e. running mHM simultaneously in several basins with different resolutions 
- Automatic check case framework, i.e. testing new implementations on their validity and back-compatibility
- Implementation of inflow gauges, i.e. feeding discharge time series into the model at catchment boundaries for not modeled upstream areas
- chunk-wise reading of data, i.e. in case of large input data only chunks of data are read such that memory is not completely filled
- File gaugeinfo.txt specifying gauging stations is removed and now part of namelist mhm.nml
- Code is now free of Numerical Recipes 
- mHM can now run on a single cell (no routing performed)
- running mHM with hydrological modeling resolution (L1) equal to morphological input data resolution (L0) now possible
- Windows compatibility (under Cygwin) verified
- Implementation for support of regular geographic coordinate systems (e.g Mercator) additional to the regular projected coordinate systems

Bugs resolved:
- Initialization of states was not correct when running mHM in calibration mode.
- Parameter values (mhm_parameters.nml) not necessarily in bound (check added).
- Aggregation/Disaggregation of meteorological data corrected.
- Forecast with mHM did not work because modeling period was restricted to discharge data period.
- Wrong mapping of evaluation discharge gauges for runs involving multiple gauges.

Known bugs:
- None.
