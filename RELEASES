     New Features of mHM v5.1
     (released at Jun 1st, 2014)
----------------------------------------

New Features:
- OpenMP handling of routines such as the multi-scale parameter regionalization (MPR)
- Multi-scale implementation, i.e. running mHM simultaneously in several basins with different resolutions
- Automatic check case framework, i.e. testing new implementations on their validity and back-compatibility
- Implementation of inflow gauges, i.e. feeding discharge time series from upstream areas at catchment boundaries
- File gaugeinfo.txt specifying gauging stations is now part of namelist mhm.nml
- Code is now free of Numerical Recipes proprietary code
- Can now run on a single cell (no routing performed)
- Hydrological modelling resolution (L1) equal to morphological input data resolution (L0) possible
- Windows compatible (with Cygwin)
- Support of regular geographic coordinate systems (e.g lat-lon) in addition to equal-area coordinate systems (UTM)

Bugs resolved:
- Initialization of states was not correct when running mHM in calibration mode.
- Calculated parameter values (mhm_parameters.nml) not necessarily in bound (check added).
- Aggregation/Disaggregation of meteorological data corrected.
- Forecast with mHM did not work because modelling period was restricted to discharge data period.
- Wrong mapping of evaluation discharge gauges for runs involving multiple gauges.

Known bugs:
- None.
