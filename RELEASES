     New Features of mHM v5.2
     (released at Dec 1st, 2014)
----------------------------------------

New Features:
- chunk-wise reading of input data (see "timestep_model_inputs" in mhm.nml)
- complete revision of writing netCDF files
- possibility to discard multi-scale parameter regionalization (MPR) calculations (see "perform_mpr" in mhm.nml)
- several process descriptions of evapotranspiration implemented (see processCase(4) in mhm.nml): 
  (0) Read in potential evapotranspiration
  (1) Hargreaves-samani
  (2) Priestley-Taylor
  (3) Penman-Monteith
   --> please contact Matthias Zink (matthias.zink@ufz.de) if you use (1)-(3) since the code is not under GNU Public license up to now
- adding routines for signature calculations of time series (see src/mo_signatures.f90)
- new objective function for calibrating discharge with Kling-Gupta efficiency measure (see opti_function in mhm.nml)
- new output variables implemented (see mhm_outputs.nml)
- sorting algorithm changed to public available library orderpack (mo_orderpack.f90)

Bugs resolved:
- 

Known bugs:
- None.

     New Features of mHM v5.1
     (released at Jun 1st, 2014)
----------------------------------------

New Features:
- OpenMP handling of routines such as the multi-scale parameter regionalization (MPR)
- Multi-scale implementation, i.e. running mHM simultaneously in several basins with different resolutions
- Automatic check case framework, i.e. testing new implementations on their validity and back-compatibility
- Implementation of inflow gauges, i.e. feeding discharge time series from upstream areas at catchment boundaries
- File gaugeinfo.txt specifying gauging stations is now part of namelist mhm.nml
- Code is now free of Numerical Recipes proprietary code
- Can now run on a single cell (no routing performed)
- Hydrological modelling resolution (L1) equal to morphological input data resolution (L0) possible
- Windows compatible (with Cygwin)
- Support of regular geographic coordinate systems (e.g lat-lon) in addition to equal-area coordinate systems (UTM)

Bugs resolved:
- Initialization of states was not correct when running mHM in calibration mode.
- Calculated parameter values (mhm_parameters.nml) not necessarily in bound (check added).
- Aggregation/Disaggregation of meteorological data corrected.
- Forecast with mHM did not work because modelling period was restricted to discharge data period.
- Wrong mapping of evaluation discharge gauges for runs involving multiple gauges.

Known bugs:
- Print out of River network in Config File is wrong for Multi-Basin setup, i.e., the River network is always correctly written for the first basin, but in correctly for following basins when these are either different ones or the same one with a different Hydrology or Routing resolution.
